# NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq

NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq provides legacy MSMQ support for the Messaging Bridge and ServiceControl as a source-only package.

NOTE: NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq requires the .NET Framework with MSMQ installed and enabled locally. It can only be used with NServiceBus 8 and below. Because Microsoft is not making MSMQ available for .NET Core, building new systems using MSMQ is not recommended. See [MSMQ is dead](https://particular.net/blog/msmq-is-dead) for details.

See the [MSMQ Transport documentation](https://docs.particular.net/transports/msmq/) for more information.
