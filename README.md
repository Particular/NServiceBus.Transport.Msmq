# NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq

NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq provides legacy MSMQ support for the Messaging Bridge and ServiceControl as a source-only package.

NOTE: NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq requires the .NET Framework and can only be used with NServiceBus 8 and below. As Microsoft is not making MSMQ available for .NET Core, building new systems using MSMQ is not recommended. See [MSMQ is dead](https://particular.net/blog/msmq-is-dead) for details.

See the [MSMQ Transport documentation](https://docs.particular.net/transports/msmq/) for more information.

## Running tests locally

MSMQ needs to be installed and enabled on the current machine.See the [MSMQ configuration documentation](https://docs.particular.net/transports/msmq/?version=msmqtransport_2#msmq-configuration) on how to install MSMQ.
